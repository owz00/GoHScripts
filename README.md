To setup the script, change this line of code so that it points towards the desired directory
game_dir = 'Steam/steamapps/common/Call to Arms - Gates of Hell/mods/"your mode name here"'

The files need to be already unpacked and a excel file placed in the same folder as the mod directory.
For modifying "Breeds" name the excel file "GoHBreeds" and for tank modifying name it "GoHStats"

Furthermore make sure that all relevant python libraries have been installed. To install a library type 'pip install 'library name'.
